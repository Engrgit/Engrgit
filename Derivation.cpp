           My surname is Gbadegesin. It is a royal name in Yoruba land which literally means "to take the crown and climb a horse". 
             In the olden days the best form of  transportation is via horses. Anybody that can take the crown and climb a horse must be a powerful ruler.

             "Gbe" = Take
             "Ade" = Crown
             "Gunesin" = Climb an horse

             "Gbeadegunesin" = "Gbadegesin"       //due to short form abbreviation of words for quick pronunciation. 
              Hence,
             "Gunesin" = "Gesin" = climb an horse
