### Hi, I'm Ibrahim 👋

I'm a [robotics developer/Artificial Intelligence Engineer](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UaaQuMQd2msDRlxLd7GH1EQkJZzcQxlcYOMyBRWk1wY/edit?usp=sharing). I enjoy developing robots and writing highly optimised computer programs. I spend a lot of time innovating tech solutions for the African Market.

  * 🌱 I’m currently learning  algorithms with C++ and python.
  * 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on ideas in computer vision and reinforcement learning.
  * ✨ I'm currently self employed at Gamol Studio, a game platform  for developing AI applications.
  * ✍ I write a lot! I [blog](ibrahimgbadegesin@gmail.com) about my experience about robotics and AI in general from the African perspective.
  * ⚡ After high school, I learnt 2D & 3D designs for 6 months. This sets the baseline for my idea visualisation in robotics and game development. I love demos!
  * 🌍 Ask me about tech innovation in Africa.
  * 😎 Fun fact: I love sight seeing. I watch tech movies a lot and enjoy reading leadership books.

I'm best reached via email or [@engrgit](https://twitter.com/Engrgit) on socials. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
