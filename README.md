### Hi, I'm Ibrahim 👋

Currently on a mission of advancing humanity with machine learning solutions. Interested but not limited to problems in computer vision and reinforcement learning. In love with C++ and fast implementation with python. My heart is tech and my path is ML. Any problem that crosses my path through my heart, I solve wholeheartedly.

  * 🤝 I collaborate on ideas in computer vision and reinforcement learning.
  * ✨ I serve as a visioner at Gamol Studio, a game platform  for developing AI applications in Africa.
  * ✍ I write a lot! I [blog](https://ibrahimgbadegesin.blogspot.com/) about my experience about robotics and AI in general from the African perspective.
  * ⚡ After high school, I learnt 2D & 3D designs for 6 months. This sets the baseline for my idea visualisation in robotics and game development. I love demos!
  * 🌍 Ask me about tech innovation in Africa.
  * 😎 Fun fact: I love sight seeing. I also love fussing my culture and love for art into my tech solutions. #my wierd repo names are cool in my world ☺

I'm best reached via email. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
