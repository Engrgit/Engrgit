### Hi, I'm Ibrahim 👋
 
  * 🤝 I collaborate on ideas in computer vision and reinforcement learning.
  * ✨ I serve as a visioner at Gamol Studio, a game platform  for developing AI applications in Africa.
  * ✍ I write a lot! I [blog](https://ibrahimgbadegesin.blogspot.com/) about my experience about robotics and AI in general from the African perspective.
  * ⚡ After high school, I learnt 2D & 3D designs for 6 months. This sets the baseline for my idea visualisation in robotics and game development. I love demos!
  * 🌍 Ask me about tech innovation in Africa.
  * 😎 Fun fact: I love fussing my culture and art into my tech solutions. 🤔 my wierd repo names are cool in my world ☺

I'm best reached via email. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
