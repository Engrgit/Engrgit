### My surname is Gbadegesin. It is a royal name in Yoruba land which literally means "to take the crown and climb a horse"

In the olden days the best form of  transportation is via horses. Anybody that can take the crown and climb a horse must be a powerful ruler.

Gbe = Take

Ade = Crown

Gunesin = Climb an horse
 Gbeadegunesin = Gbadegesin due to short form abbreviation of words for quick pronunciation. Hence, Gunesin= Gesin = climb an horse

Mathematical Derivation

Assumptions:

Am an engineer, Short forms are permitted, the final nickname should be a one word that embodies my name and my attributes

Methodology

variables in strings:  fullname, nickname, title

variable initialisation:

Title-  My education and skills proves that am an Engineer. Since short form is allowed .

Engineer = Engr.

Fullname-  shows my complete identity =  Gbadegesin Ibrahim Tosin

However, since  short form is allowed. Reducting Each string in the name to a character for quick representation  would mean Gbadegesin = "G",  Ibrahim = "I", Tosin = "T"

fullname = "G" + "I" + "T"

    fullname = "GIT"

nickname =  title + fullname

nickname = Engr + GIT

nickname = EngrGIT

Applying short form to nickname yields  lowercase(nickname) = Engrgit

Therefore Nickname = Engrgit
